    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Inspired by the famous dish at Jon and Vinny's in LA, this dish is a great dish to make for a romantic date night. Another great thing about this dish is that it's relatively simple to make, which is excellent practice for any home cook. Creamy, tasty, and with a hint of heat this pasta is famous for a reason.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>4 Servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 shallot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove, finely grated</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vodka</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound fusili</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 ounce finely grate Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until paste is brick red and starts to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add vodka and cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add cream and red pepper flakes and stir until well blended. Season with salt and pepper; remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Add pasta to skillet with sauce along with butter and Â½ cup pasta cooking liquid. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until butter has melted and a thick, glossy sauce has formed, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and add 1 oz. Parmesan, tossing to coat. Divide pasta among bowls, then top with basil and more Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Do Ahead: Vodka sauce can be made 5 days ahead; cover and chill.</li>
        </ol>
