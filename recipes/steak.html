    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for some steaaakk. Deceivingly simply, cooking a perfect steak is a skill that everyone should have in their back pocket. Even for my vegetarian/vegan friends, you never know when you'll end up on the next season of masterchef.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New York Steak, Top Sirloin Steak, or Ribeye steak (1-1/4" thick)</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
            <li>Oil with high smoking point</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Cast iron-pan</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
            <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
            <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
            <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
            <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.
            </li>

        </ol>
